                  This creates the database from an existing Neo4j backup or dump file
                  located at the specified URI. The seeding occurs during database creation,
                  before any initial data import.

                  Supported URI schemes (via Neo4j CloudSeedProvider):
                  - Amazon S3: s3://bucket/path/backup.backup
                  - Google Cloud Storage: gs://bucket/path/backup.backup
                  - Azure Blob Storage: azb://container/path/backup.backup
                  - HTTP/HTTPS: https://server/path/backup.backup
                  - FTP: ftp://server/path/backup.backup

                  Cloud authentication is configured system-wide via:
                  - S3: IAM roles, AWS credentials, or service account annotations
                  - GCS: Service account keys or workload identity

                  This defines how the database is distributed across the available cluster servers.
                  The cluster provides server infrastructure (e.g., 5 servers), and this topology
                  specifies how many of those servers should act as primaries vs secondaries
                  for this specific database.

                  Multiple databases can have different topologies within the same cluster:
                  - Cluster: 5 servers
                  - Database A: 3 primaries, 1 secondary (uses 4 servers)
                  - Database B: 2 primaries, 0 secondaries (uses 2 servers)

                  Servers self-organize into primary/secondary roles at the database level.
