                                          If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                          Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                          tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
